# About Me

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/zhengjianzhao.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Guanghui Song(sheen, 宋广辉)**.

I am a final-year undergrad majoring in EECS at Fuzhou University and Maynooth University (Combined Degrees). Currently, I serve as a research assistant at the IIoT-Lab, advised by [Prof. Zhezhuang Xu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhezhuang-Xu) and [Dr. Meng Yuan](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Meng-Yuan-4). I also spent a lovely summer research program with [Prof. Pietro Liò](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) at Cambridge University. Recently, I have been selected as an **AAAI & KDD UC Scholar**.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at - *hanlin[dot]cai[at]ieee[dot]org*
